### Step2:
* Select the difficulty mode from the menu bar on the left side of the interface:

    `Simple-1: game tree search with depth 1, Player goes first (Which is just heuristic search)`

    `Simple-2: game tree search with depth 1, AI goes first`

    `Normal-1: game tree search with depth 3(with alpha beta cut), Player goes first`

    `Normal-2: game tree search with depth 3(with alpha beta cut), AI goes first`

![Alt text](https://github.com/zuoyigehaobing/Gomoku-GameTreeSearch/blob/master/img/instruction3.png?raw=true "Mode")

(if you want try different depths, you can also manually set the depth in the minimax search file. However, if it is larger than 4, the response time for each step is crazy long since the searching state is so huge)
